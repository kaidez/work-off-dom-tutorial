#WHAT IS THIS?

This is the corresponding source code for the screencast tutorial, ["Working off-DOM with elements in JavaScript"](http://kaidez.com/javascript-off-dom/) by [Kai "kaidez" Gittens](http://twitter.com/kaidez). While it focuses on doing stuff off-DOM, going through this tutorial should help you gain a basic understanding of how to traverse and manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

The primary inspiration for this tutorial was Paul Irish's excellent screencast, ["HTML5, CSS3, and DOM Performance"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_O9_C2ZjoA). He discussed client-side reflows and repaints and I wanted to figure learn more about them. In the process of researching and learning about them, I learned a lot of interesting things about how the DOM works. I'm just sharing what I learned here.

##Here are the links to the screencast videos on YouTube:

(links have to go here...)

##Before starting this tutorial, you should understand the following:

* variables in JavaScript [(learn more about this at MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)
* arrays in JavaScript [(learn more about this at MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

Arrays are THE most important thing to understand for this tutorial as an array plays a big part in locating data at some point in the code. Please review the MDN link above if you don't know arrays.

##After finishing the tutorial, you should gain a basic understand the following JavaScript stuff:

    createDocumentFragment()
    createElement()
    createTextNode()
    cloneNode()
    appendChild()
    getElementById()
    innerHTML
    childNodes
